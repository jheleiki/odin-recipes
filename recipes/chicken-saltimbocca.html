        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An Italian style dish made with chicken instead of the traditional veal.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>800g baby potatoes</li>
                <li>2 chicken breast fillets, halved horizontally</li>
                <li>4 slices prosciutto</li>
                <li>8 sage leaves</li>
                <li>20g butter</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tbsp chopped sage</li>
                <li>120g pkt mixed salad leaves</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cook potatoes in a saucepan of boiling water for 15 mins or until tender.</li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, place the chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Use a rolling pin or meat mallet to gently pound until 1cm thick. Place 1 prosciutto slice on a clean work surface. Top with 2 sage leaves. Place 1 piece of chicken in the centre and wrap the prosciutto around the chicken, pressing firmly to secure. Repeat with the remaining prosciutto, sage leaves and chicken.</li>
                <li>Add the butter and oil to a large frying pan over medium heat. Place the chicken, sage-side up, in the pan and cook for 2 mins. Turn and cook for a further 2 mins or until chicken is golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a plate and loosely cover with foil.</li>
                <li>Drain the potatoes. Add to the pan with the chopped sage. Toss to coat.
                </li>            
                <li>Divide chicken, potatoes and salad leaves among serving plates. Season.
                </li>                
            </ol>
